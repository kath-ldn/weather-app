# Weather App

## About

This is a simple App that allows a user to search for the weather of a specific city. I developed it for [The Odin Project, Full Stack Web Development Course, Javascript Module, Project: Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

The user types a city name in the search bar, and presses go to see the weather data. The user can choose between farenheight and celcius data.

The objective of this project was to practice getting & using data from APIs. I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current).

## Roadmap

Future versions to include
* Support for mis-spelled / incomplete city names;

### Known Issues

* Currently the OpenWeather API key is accessible client side which is not secure. I would not do this for a more sensitive API.
